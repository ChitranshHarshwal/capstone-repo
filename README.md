# PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OVERVIEW
Companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galatic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Doom is a small satellite provider. Let's focus on Space X; sending spacecraft to the International Space Station; Sending manned missions to space; and Starlink providing satellite internet access. 
A reason why Space X can do this is because launches are relatively inexpensive.

for example, the Falcon 9 rocket costs $62 million whereas other providers cost $165 million. There are more savings in Space X as it can reuse the first stage (which does most of the work. This stage is quite large and expensive).

Therefore, if one can determine whether the first stage will land, one can also determine the cost of a launch. Sometimes it can crash. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to mission parameters like payload, and orbit.

In this project, one will take the role of a Data Scientist working for a new rocket company Rocketry which like to compete with Space X. The job is to determine the price of each launch. This can be done by gathering information about Space X and creating a dashboard for the team. Also, determine if Space X will reuse the first stage. To achieve this objective one can train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if Space X reuses the first stage.
